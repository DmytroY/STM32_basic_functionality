## PWM output generation by timer

# In Pinout & Configuration
In TIM1 parameter settings:
- Choose timer which capable generate PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)
- Enable clock source (Internal Clock)
- Set Channel1 to PWM Generation GH1
- Set prescaler so it will be easy to calculate pulce period. For example if clock tiking with 48MHz and you ser prescaler to (48-1) timer will tick every 1 mks
- Set counter period. For example if you set it ro (100-1) timer will reset after every 100 ticks

In TIM1 DMA settings:
- add TIM_CH1 DMA request which Direction "Memory to Peripheral"

In the code you should specify impulce width `TIM1->CCR1 = <impulse length>;`
and start timer in PWM mode `HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&htim1, TIM_CHANNEL_1);`

Also in that exersice I put jump wire from TIM1 output pin PA8 to PB0, so I can read PB0 to check PWM generated by timer. To visualise it I used CubeMonitor.

Blue Button used to cause interruption an incrementaly increase PEM pulse width.
